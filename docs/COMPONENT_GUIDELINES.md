# Component Guidelines

This document captures shared conventions for Fluxora Frontend components. Follow
these guidelines when adding new components or refactoring existing ones so the
codebase stays consistent and easy to review.

## Address formatting

### Always use `formatAddress` for mid-string truncation

All display of Stellar addresses in compact form (head…tail) must go through the
single exported utility `formatAddress` from
`src/components/common/TruncatedAddress.tsx`.

```ts
import { formatAddress } from "../common/TruncatedAddress";

// ✅ Correct — uses the shared utility
const label = formatAddress(stream.recipient);            // "GABCDE...LOWN"
const label = formatAddress(address, 8, 4);              // custom prefix/suffix

// ❌ Incorrect — inline reimplementation drifts silently
const label = `${address.slice(0, 6)}...${address.slice(-4)}`;
```

#### Why

Before this utility existed, `StreamRow.tsx`, `WalletButton.tsx`, and
`WalletStatus.tsx` each maintained their own inline slice expression. The head and
tail character counts had quietly drifted apart:

| Call site | Before |
|---|---|
| `StreamRow.tsx` | `slice(0, 6)...slice(-4)` (threshold `> 14`) |
| `WalletButton.tsx` | `slice(0, 6)...slice(-4)` (no threshold — always) |
| `WalletStatus.tsx` | `maskAddress(address, 6, 4)` (delegated, but redundant) |
| `TruncatedAddress.tsx` | `slice(0, 6)...slice(-4)` (threshold `> 12`) |

This was consolidated in [#1288] into one utility so any future change to the
format touches exactly one place.

#### API

```ts
/**
 * Formats a Stellar address with mid-string truncation for compact display.
 *
 * @param address   The address to truncate.
 * @param prefixLen Characters to keep at the start. Default: 6.
 * @param suffixLen Characters to keep at the end.   Default: 4.
 * @returns The truncated string, or the original if short enough.
 */
export function formatAddress(
  address: string,
  prefixLen = 6,
  suffixLen = 4,
): string
```

Addresses with `length ≤ prefixLen + suffixLen` are returned unchanged.

#### Accessible component vs. plain text

For **interactive UI** (copy buttons, share, reveal chips), use the
`<TruncatedAddress>` component directly — it includes sr-only full-address spans,
ARIA labels, clipboard and Web Share API support, and focus management.

For **plain formatted text** (table cells, aria-labels, announcement strings),
call `formatAddress(address)`.

---

## Accessibility requirements

All new components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA. Specifically:

- Interactive elements must have a minimum touch target of 44 × 44 CSS px
  (see `.kiro/specs/touch-target-accessibility`).
- Color contrast for text must be at least 4.5 : 1 (normal) / 3 : 1 (large).
  Use `evaluateContrast` from `src/utils/contrastUtils.ts` to validate.
- Every interactive element must be keyboard operable and have a visible
  focus indicator using `var(--color-focus)`.
- Informational icons must carry `aria-hidden="true"`. Controls must carry
  an `aria-label` or be associated with a visible label.

## Shared design tokens

Always use CSS variables from `src/design-tokens.css` and `src/index.css` rather
than hardcoded colour literals or pixel values. Common tokens:

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `var(--color-accent-primary)` | Primary interactive colour |
| `var(--color-text-primary)` | Body text |
| `var(--color-text-muted)` | Secondary / caption text |
| `var(--color-border-default)` | Dividers and input borders |
| `var(--color-surface-elevated)` | Cards and elevated surfaces |
| `var(--radius-sm)` | Small corner radius |
| `var(--transition-fast)` | Micro-interaction duration |

## Wallet state

Read wallet address and network exclusively through `useWallet()` from
`src/components/wallet-connect/Walletcontext.tsx`. Do not import
`@stellar/freighter-api` directly in component code.
